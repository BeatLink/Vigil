# Vigil

Vigil is a web-based network and systems monitor for Linux systems, homelabs, and small networks. Inspired by Uptime Kuma, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki, it provides a centralized dashboard to configure and manage diverse infrastructure from a single pane of glass — without requiring agents on remote hosts.

Unlike most network and system monitors, Vigil is designed to be highly extensible and capable of performing actions on monitored targets, not just observing them.

---

## Features

- **Pull-Based & Agentless**: Uses a pull-based design over SSH and ICMP to collect events, logs, and metrics — no software needed on target nodes.
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time interactive visualizations built with NiceGUI and ECharts, featuring latency history, status distribution, and log views.
- **Alerting & Notifications**: Sends alerts to various channels when events or metric thresholds are detected. *(WIP)*
- **Target Control**: Trigger actions on monitored targets (e.g. restarting systemd services) directly from the UI.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Core features are implemented through plugins called "monitors" which handle specific domains (systemd services, host uptime, hardware parameters, etc.).
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Organize monitors into nested groups by location, service, or environment.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and low resource footprint.
- **Easy Development**: Fully written in Python.

---

## Architecture

Vigil is organized around a **CPAC** model — each plugin is responsible for its own implementation of these four functions:

- **Collection**: Gathering events, metrics, and logs from specific targets via SSH, ICMP, HTTP, etc.
- **Presentation**: Rendering collected data on the web dashboard via each plugin's `render_ui()` method.
- **Alerting**: Monitoring configured thresholds and sending notifications through channels (Email, Slack, Webhooks) when criteria are met.
- **Control**: Sending remediation commands back to targets (e.g. restarting services) directly from the platform.

### Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: `main.py` loads config definitions and recursively instantiates plugins. `GroupPlugin` instances act as containers for nested monitors.
2. **Polling Loop**: The engine runs an async loop, calling `run_cycle()` on all non-group plugin instances.
3. **Collection & Processing**: Plugins use collectors in `core/modules/collectors` to gather data from targets.
4. **Persistence**: Results are stored in the SQLite database via the persistence layer in `core/data`.
5. **Visualization**: The dashboard renders a recursive sidebar; each plugin renders its own detail view.
6. **Alerting & Control**: On failure detection, plugins trigger alerts or execute remediation via controllers.

All plugin types share these common fields:

| Field    | Description                                                          |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`   | Display name shown in the sidebar and dashboard                      |
| `id`     | Unique identifier used internally (defaults to `name` if omitted)    |
| `type`   | Plugin type — one of `uptime`, `push`, `dns_record`, `ddns_updater`, `systemd_service`, `service_list`, `smart_disk`, `zfs_health`, `zfs_pool`, `disk_space`, `network_usage`, `diskio`, `interrupts`, `connections`, `wifi`, `ports`, `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `temperature`, `load_average`, `processes`, `borg`, `gpu`, `containers`, `raid`, `command`, `filesystems`, `folders`, `vms`, `cloud`, `group` |
| `interval` | Polling frequency in seconds (default: 60)                         |

---

### `uptime`
Checks host availability using ICMP ping.

| Option        | Description                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `target_host` | IP address or hostname to ping                     |
| `interval`    | Polling frequency in seconds (default: `60`)       |

**Metrics**: `up` (1/0), `latency_ms`

```yaml
- name: "Core Gateway"
  id: "gateway-ping"
  type: "uptime"
  target_host: "192.168.1.1"
  interval: 30
```

---

### `push`
The inverse of every other monitor: instead of Vigil reaching out to a target, an external script, cron job, or task with no fixed host calls Vigil's REST API to say "I'm alive." Vigil reports `failed` once a heartbeat hasn't arrived within `max_age` — a dead man's switch, not a poll.

`interval` controls how often Vigil *checks* for staleness, not how often heartbeats are expected — that's `max_age`'s job. A missing `max_age` defaults to twice the interval, tolerating one missed beat before alarming.

| Option      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_age`   | Seconds since the last heartbeat before reporting `failed` (default: `interval * 2`) |
| `token`     | Shared secret the caller must present when pushing. **Required** — without one, anyone who can reach the API could mark this monitor healthy. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 20`. |
| `interval`  | How often the staleness check itself runs (default: `60`)                    |

**Metrics**: `last_push_epoch` (Unix timestamp of the last heartbeat), `reported_up` (1/0, the caller's own status), `value` (optional, if the caller supplies one)

To push a heartbeat, hit `GET` or `POST /api/push/{id}/{token}`, optionally with `status` (`up` or `down`, default `up`), `msg`, and `value` query parameters. This endpoint is not covered by the dashboard's HTTP Basic Auth (see [Authentication](#authentication)) — the per-monitor token is its credential instead.

```yaml
- name: "Nightly Backup Job"
  id: "nightly-backup"
  type: "push"
  interval: 1h
  max_age: 26h   # daily job, tolerate one slipped run
  token: "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."   # openssl rand -hex 20
```

```bash
# At the end of the cron job:
curl "https://vigil.example.com/api/push/nightly-backup/a1b2c3d4e5f6...?status=up"

# Or report a failure the job detected itself, while still checking in on time:
curl "https://vigil.example.com/api/push/nightly-backup/a1b2c3d4e5f6...?status=down&msg=disk+full"
```

---

### `dns_record`
Resolves a DNS record and reports failed on NXDOMAIN, no answer, a timeout, or (when `expected` is set) an answer outside the accepted values — catching a stale record, a botched migration, or a DNS provider outage.

Runs in-process via [dnspython](https://www.dnspython.org/) rather than over SSH: there is no target host, only a domain to ask about. Query the system resolver by default, or point `resolver` at a specific one (public or internal) — doing so doubles as a liveness probe for that resolver, distinct from [`unbound`](#unbound)'s SERVFAIL-rate monitoring of one resolver's own stats.

| Option        | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `domain`      | Domain name to query *(required)*                                            |
| `record_type` | One of `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `TXT`, `NS`, `SOA` (default: `A`)          |
| `resolver`    | Resolver IP to query directly (default: system resolver)                     |
| `port`        | Resolver port (default: `53`)                                                |
| `timeout`     | Query timeout in seconds (default: `5`)                                      |
| `expected`    | *(Optional)* List of acceptable answer values. Any answer outside this list fails the monitor. Order-independent — only presence in the answer set is checked. |

**Metrics**: `resolved` (1/0), `ttl` (seconds), `matches_expected` (1/0, only when `expected` is set)

```yaml
# Pin an A record to known IPs — fails if it ever points elsewhere
- name: "Website A Record"
  id: "website-a-record"
  type: "dns_record"
  domain: "example.com"
  record_type: "A"
  expected:
    - "93.184.216.34"
  interval: 5m

# Confirm MX still points at the expected mail provider
- name: "Mail Routing"
  id: "example-mx"
  type: "dns_record"
  domain: "example.com"
  record_type: "MX"
  expected:
    - "10 mail.example.com"
  interval: 1h

# Query a specific resolver directly, e.g. to check an internal DNS server
- name: "Internal DNS"
  id: "internal-dns-check"
  type: "dns_record"
  domain: "heimdall.technet"
  resolver: "10.0.0.1"
  interval: 1m
```

### `ddns_updater`
Keeps a DNS record pointed at this network's current public IP, and reports on it while doing so — a built-in replacement for standalone dynamic-DNS-updater services. Each cycle: look up the current public IP, resolve what the domain currently answers publicly, and push an update to the provider only when the two differ. Because a provider update is a real side effect (and most providers rate-limit or ban accounts that call too often), it is never fired on a fixed schedule — only on detected drift, and even then no more often than `min_interval`.

Currently speaks FreeDNS's (afraid.org, including `*.mooo.com` and its other free subdomains) per-host dynamic update URL convention: a plain HTTPS GET to a secret, account-specific URL that updates the record to the caller's apparent IP, responding `good <ip>` or `nochg <ip>` on success. Other providers using the same "secret update URL" convention work too; anything returning JSON or requiring a signed request does not, yet.

Resolves the public record against an explicit `resolver` (default `8.8.8.8`) rather than the local/default resolver — a local network commonly has a hosts-file override pinning this exact hostname to a LAN IP (so internal clients don't route out to the internet and back for it), which would mask real DDNS drift by always answering with that LAN IP instead.

| Option        | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `domain`      | Domain whose public record is kept current *(required)*                      |
| `update_url`  | Provider's per-host dynamic update URL, including its own secret token       |
| `update_url_file` | Path to a file containing the update URL (keeps the token out of config.yaml) |
| `update_url_command` | Shell command whose stdout is the update URL                         |
| `resolver`    | Resolver IP to check the current public record against (default: `8.8.8.8`)  |
| `record_type` | Record type being kept current (default: `A`)                                |
| `timeout`     | Timeout in seconds for both the IP lookup and the update request (default: `10`) |
| `min_interval`| Minimum seconds between update attempts regardless of how often `interval` ticks (default: `300`) |

Precedence when more than one update-URL source is set: `update_url` > `update_url_file` > `update_url_command`.

**Metrics**: `in_sync` (1/0), `last_update_epoch` (Unix timestamp of the last successful push)

**Actions**: Force Update — pushes an update immediately regardless of detected drift, bypassing `min_interval`.

- name: "DDNS"

Monitors systemd units over SSH. Operates in two modes depending on whether `max_age` is set.

**Continuous mode** (default) — for long-running daemons. Checks `systemctl is-active` each cycle and reports `online`/`warning`/`failed`.

**Oneshot mode** (`max_age` set) — for timer-driven services that run and exit (e.g. `nixos-upgrade`, backup jobs). Checks the result and timestamp of the last completed run via `systemctl show`. Reports `failed` if the last run did not succeed or completed more than `max_age` seconds ago.

| Option         | Description                                                                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `service_name` | Name of the systemd unit (e.g. `nginx.service`)                                 |
| `lines`        | Number of `journalctl` log lines to fetch per cycle (default: `10`)             |
| `interval`     | Polling frequency in seconds (default: `60`)                                    |
| `max_age`      | *(Oneshot mode)* Max seconds since last successful run before reporting `failed` |
| `ssh_config`   | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below                    |
| `allow_unit_file_edit` | Enable UI editing of the target service unit file. Defaults to `false`. |
| `allowed_write_paths` | Optional list of absolute paths where unit file writes are permitted. Defaults to standard systemd unit paths. |

**Continuous metrics**: `active` (1/0)

**Oneshot metrics**: `last_run_epoch` (Unix timestamp), `last_run_success` (1/0)

**Actions**: Restart Service, Stop Service, Enable on Boot, Disable on Boot

The service detail UI also includes:

* `View Unit File` for the configured service
* `Reload Daemon` to run `systemctl daemon-reload`
* `Edit Unit File` when `allow_unit_file_edit: true` is enabled

> Note: Remote editing requires passwordless sudo access for the service commands and the configured write helper (currently `python3` on the target). Restrict `allowed_write_paths` carefully.

```yaml
# Continuous — long-running daemon
- name: "Nginx"
  id: "nginx-service"
  type: "systemd_service"
  service_name: "nginx.service"

### `smart_disk`
Monitors SMART health of all physical disks over SSH. Discovers disks automatically via `lsblk` and runs `smartctl -H` on each one. USB-attached disks are probed with `-d sat`.

> The SSH user must have passwordless `sudo` access to `smartctl` (e.g. `vigil ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/smartctl`).

| Option      | Description                                                        |

    host: "ragnarok.technet"
```

---

### `zfs_health`
Monitors ZFS pool health states over SSH via `zpool list -H -o name,health`. Reports failed if any pool is in a `DEGRADED`, `FAULTED`, `OFFLINE`, `UNAVAIL`, or `REMOVED` state. Complements `zfs_pool` (capacity) with structural integrity monitoring.

| Option      | Description                                                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

  id: "ragnarok-zfs-health"
  type: "zfs_health"
  interval: 3600
  ssh_config:
    host: "ragnarok.technet"
```

---

### `disk_space`
Monitors disk space usage for a path or mountpoint over SSH via `df`. Works on any mounted Linux filesystem — no ZFS or other tools required. Marks the path failed when usage exceeds the configured threshold.

| Option      | Description                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `threshold` | Usage percentage that triggers a `failed` status (default: `90`) |
| `interval`  | Polling frequency (default: `60`, recommend `10m`)                |
| `ssh_config` | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below     |

**Metrics**: `used_pct`, `size_gb`, `used_gb`, `avail_gb`

  id: "myhost-disk-root"
  type: "disk_space"
  path: "/"
  threshold: 90
  interval: 10m
  ssh_config:
    host: "myhost.example.com"
```

---

### `cpu_usage`
Monitors CPU utilization over SSH. Takes two `/proc/stat` snapshots one second apart in a single SSH command and computes the usage delta — no agents or extra tools required.

| Option          | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `cpu_warning`   | CPU % that triggers `warning` (default: `70`)   |
| `cpu_threshold` | CPU % that triggers `failed`  (default: `85`)   |
| `interval`      | Polling frequency (default: `60`)                |
| `ssh_config`    | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below |

**Metrics**: `cpu_pct`

```yaml
- name: "Heimdall CPU"
  id: "heimdall-cpu"
  type: "cpu_usage"
  interval: 1m
  cpu_warning: 70
  cpu_threshold: 85
  ssh_config:
    host: "heimdall.example.com"
```

---

### `memory_usage`
Monitors memory usage over SSH via `/proc/meminfo`. Uses `MemAvailable` (not `MemFree`) so filesystem cache is not counted as used. Single SSH read — no sleep required.

| Option              | Description                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

| `interval`          | Polling frequency (default: `60`)                     |
| `ssh_config`        | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below |

**Metrics**: `memory_pct`, `memory_used_gb`, `memory_total_gb`

```yaml
- name: "Heimdall Memory"
  id: "heimdall-memory"
  type: "memory_usage"
  interval: 1m
  memory_warning: 75
  memory_threshold: 90
  ssh_config:
    host: "heimdall.example.com"
```

---

### `temperature`
Monitors system temperature over SSH via `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp`. Reports the maximum temperature across all thermal zones. Gracefully stays `online` with no metric when no thermal zones are present (e.g. VMs).

| Option           | Description                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `temp_warning`   | °C that triggers `warning` (default: `70`)            |
| `temp_threshold` | °C that triggers `failed`  (default: `80`)            |
| `interval`       | Polling frequency (default: `60`)                      |
| `ssh_config`     | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below |

**Metrics**: `temp_c`

```yaml
- name: "Heimdall Temperature"
  id: "heimdall-temperature"
  type: "temperature"
  interval: 1m
  temp_warning: 70
  temp_threshold: 80
  ssh_config:
    host: "heimdall.example.com"
```

---

### `load_average`
Monitors system load averages over SSH via `/proc/loadavg`. Load values are normalized by CPU core count (via `nproc`) and stored as a percentage — 100% means the system is exactly at capacity. Falls back to treating core count as 1 if `nproc` is unavailable. Thresholds are optional — when unset, load is collected and displayed but does not affect status.

| Option           | Description                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `load_warning`   | 1m load as % of cores that triggers `warning` (optional — omit to disable)  |
| `load_threshold` | 1m load as % of cores that triggers `failed`  (optional — omit to disable)  |
| `interval`       | Polling frequency (default: `60`)                                             |
| `ssh_config`     | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below                 |

**Metrics**: `load_pct_1m`, `load_pct_5m`, `load_pct_15m`

```yaml
- name: "Heimdall Load"
  id: "heimdall-load"
  type: "load_average"
  interval: 1m
  load_warning: 70    # warn when 1m load exceeds 70% of available cores
  load_threshold: 100 # fail when 1m load exceeds 100% of available cores
  ssh_config:
    host: "heimdall.example.com"
```

---

### `processes`
Monitors running processes over SSH via `ps`, sorted by CPU usage. Process data is ephemeral and stored in memory only — not persisted to the database. Per-row SIGTERM and SIGKILL buttons are available directly in the UI.

| Option          | Description                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_processes` | Maximum number of processes to display (default: `20`)                       |
| `require_sudo`  | Prefix kill commands with `sudo` (default: `false`)                          |
| `kill_signal`   | Default signal for the kill action: `TERM` or `KILL` (default: `TERM`). Per-row buttons always offer both regardless of this setting. |
| `cpu_warning`   | Top-process CPU % that triggers `warning` (optional — omit to disable)       |
| `cpu_threshold` | Top-process CPU % that triggers `failed`  (optional — omit to disable)       |
| `interval`      | Polling frequency (default: `60`)                                             |
| `ssh_config`    | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below                 |

**Metrics**: `process_count`, `top_cpu_pct`

```yaml
- name: "Heimdall Processes"
  id: "heimdall-processes"
  type: "processes"
  interval: 30s
  max_processes: 20
  cpu_warning: 80
  cpu_threshold: 95
  ssh_config:
    host: "heimdall.example.com"
```

---

### `network_usage`
Monitors network interface throughput over SSH. Takes two snapshots of `/proc/net/dev` one second apart in a single SSH command — no extra tools required on the remote host.

The interface to monitor can be specified explicitly or auto-detected. In auto-detect mode, Vigil picks the non-virtual, non-loopback interface with the highest cumulative byte count, ignoring interfaces with prefixes like `lo`, `veth`, `docker`, `virbr`, `br-`, `tun`, and `tap`.

| Option       | Description                                                                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `interface`  | *(Optional)* Interface name to monitor (e.g. `eth0`). Omit to auto-detect.            |
| `interval`   | Polling frequency (default: `60`). Shorter intervals give finer-grained trend history. |
| `ssh_config` | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below                           |

**Metrics**: `rx_kbps`, `tx_kbps`

```yaml
# Auto-detect the primary interface
- name: "Heimdall Network"
  id: "heimdall-network"
  type: "network_usage"
  interval: 30s
  ssh_config:
    host: "heimdall.example.com"

# Monitor a specific interface
- name: "Ragnarok Network"
  id: "ragnarok-network"
  type: "network_usage"
  interval: 30s
  interface: "eth0"
  ssh_config:
    host: "ragnarok.example.com"
```

---

### `gpu`
Monitors NVIDIA GPU utilization, VRAM usage, and temperature over SSH via a single `nvidia-smi --query-gpu` call. Handles multiple GPUs per host — each gets its own per-GPU metrics, and the overall status is the worst level across utilization, memory, and temperature for any GPU.

If `nvidia-smi` isn't installed or no NVIDIA GPU is present, the monitor reports **offline** rather than failed, so it degrades gracefully on mixed fleets.

| Option           | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `util_warning` / `util_threshold`   | GPU utilization % bounds (default: `85` / `95`)   |
| `mem_warning` / `mem_threshold`     | VRAM usage % bounds (default: `85` / `95`)        |
| `temp_warning` / `temp_threshold`   | Temperature °C bounds (default: `80` / `90`)      |
| `ssh_config`     | SSH connection details — target must have `nvidia-smi`   |

**Metrics**: `gpu_util`, `gpu_mem_pct`, `gpu_temp` (busiest GPU); `gpu<idx>_util`, `gpu<idx>_mem_pct`, `gpu<idx>_temp` (per GPU)

```yaml
- name: "GPU"
  id: "server-gpu"
  type: "gpu"
  interval: 1m
  temp_threshold: 88
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"
```

---

### `containers`
Monitors Docker or Podman containers over SSH via `<runtime> ps -a`, counting running vs. stopped containers. Paused/created containers are treated as benign. Named containers listed in `expect_running` are required — any that are missing or not running drive the status to **failed** and expose a per-container **Restart** action in the UI. Other unexpectedly-stopped containers drive **warning** (unless `stopped_warning: false`).

For safety, the restart action only ever targets containers explicitly listed in `expect_running`.

| Option            | Description                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `runtime`         | `docker` (default) or `podman`                                         |
| `expect_running`  | *(Optional)* List of container names that must be running (→ Restart actions) |
| `stopped_warning` | Treat any stopped container as a warning (default: `true`)             |
| `ssh_config`      | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below           |

**Metrics**: `containers_total`, `containers_running`, `containers_stopped`

```yaml
- name: "Docker"
  id: "server-docker"
  type: "containers"
  interval: 1m
  runtime: "docker"
  expect_running:
    - "nginx"
    - "postgres"
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"
```

---

### `raid`
Monitors Linux software RAID (mdadm) array health over SSH by parsing `/proc/mdstat`. Each array's `[N/M] [UU__]` status is checked: any array with a down disk (`_`) or fewer active disks than expected reports **failed**; an array undergoing resync/recovery/reshape reports **warning**; all-clean reports **online**. Complements the ZFS plugins for hosts using classic mdraid. Reports **offline** when no arrays are present.

| Option       | Description                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `interval`   | Polling frequency (default: `60`; `5m` is usually plenty)   |
| `ssh_config` | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below |

**Metrics**: `arrays_total`, `arrays_ok`, `arrays_degraded`

```yaml
- name: "Software RAID"
  id: "server-raid"
  type: "raid"
  interval: 5m
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"
```

---

### `command`
The generic escape hatch: runs an arbitrary command over SSH and derives status from it, for checks that don't warrant a dedicated plugin. Two modes:

- **Exit-code mode** (no `pattern`): exit `0` → online, non-zero → failed (or warning with `nonzero_is_warning: true`).
- **Pattern mode** (`pattern` set): a regex with one capture group extracts a number from stdout, stored as the `value` metric and charted, then compared against `warning`/`threshold` — same semantics as the numeric plugins. Set `invert: true` when *lower* is worse (e.g. free space, days-until-expiry).

Every run is wrapped in `timeout` so a hung target can't stall the polling loop.

| Option              | Description                                                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `command`           | Shell command to run on the target *(required)*                         |
| `timeout`           | Per-run timeout in seconds (default: `30`)                              |
| `pattern`           | *(Optional)* Regex with one capture group extracting a number           |
| `warning` / `threshold` | Value bounds (pattern mode only)                                    |
| `invert`            | If true, values *below* the bounds are bad (default: `false`)           |
| `nonzero_is_warning`| Treat non-zero exit as warning instead of failed (default: `false`)     |
| `value_label` / `value_unit` | UI label / unit suffix for the extracted value                 |
| `ssh_config`        | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below            |

**Metrics**: `exit_code` (always); `value` (pattern mode)

```yaml
# Pattern mode: TLS cert expiry, fewer days left is worse
- name: "Cert Expiry"
  id: "server-cert"
  type: "command"
  interval: 6h
  command: 'echo "days=$(( ($(date -d "$(openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in /etc/ssl/cert.pem | cut -d= -f2)" +%s) - $(date +%s)) / 86400 ))"'
  pattern: 'days=(-?\d+)'
  warning: 21
  threshold: 7
  invert: true
  value_label: "DAYS LEFT"
  value_unit: " d"
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"

# Exit-code mode: pending reboot -> warning
- name: "Reboot Required"
  id: "server-reboot"
  type: "command"
  interval: 1h
  command: "test ! -f /var/run/reboot-required"
  nonzero_is_warning: true
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"
```

---

### `filesystems`
Auto-discovers and monitors **every** mounted filesystem on the target over SSH via a single `df` call — no per-path configuration. This is the fleet-wide counterpart to [`disk_space`](#disk_space) (which watches one explicit path). Pseudo/virtual filesystems (tmpfs, proc, cgroup, overlay, …) are excluded so only real storage appears. Overall status is the worst usage across all filesystems.

| Option       | Description                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `warning`    | Usage % that triggers warning (default: `80`)               |
| `threshold`  | Usage % that triggers failed (default: `90`)                |
| `ssh_config` | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below |

**Metrics**: `worst_used_pct`; `fs_<mount>_used_pct`, `fs_<mount>_size_gb` per filesystem

```yaml
- name: "Filesystems"
  id: "server-filesystems"
  type: "filesystems"
  interval: 5m
  warning: 80
  threshold: 90
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"
```

---

### `folders`
Monitors the size of arbitrary directories over SSH via `du` — for watching things a filesystem check can't see: a growing log directory, a download spool, a media library nearing a soft cap. Each folder may set its own `warning`/`threshold` (in GB); a folder with neither is size-only. A folder that can't be read (missing/permission/timeout) reports failed.

| Option     | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `folders`  | List of `{ path, warning?, threshold? }` — warning/threshold are sizes in GB |
| `timeout`  | Per-`du` timeout in seconds (default: `60`)                                 |
| `ssh_config` | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below              |

**Metrics**: `worst_folder_gb`; `folder_<path>_gb` per folder

```yaml
- name: "Folders"
  id: "server-folders"
  type: "folders"
  interval: 1h
  folders:
    - path: "/var/log"
      warning: 5
      threshold: 10
    - path: "/srv/media"   # size-only
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"
```

### `vms`
Monitors libvirt/KVM virtual machines over SSH via `virsh list --all`, counting running vs. off. Domains in an error state (paused, crashed) drive warning; "shut off" is treated as benign. Named domains in `expect_running` are required — any not running drives status to **failed** and exposes per-VM **Start**/**Shutdown** actions (restricted to listed domains for safety).

| Option           | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uri`            | libvirt connection URI (default: `qemu:///system`)               |
| `expect_running` | *(Optional)* Domain names that must be running (→ Start/Shutdown) |
| `offline_warning`| Any error-state domain => warning (default: `true`)              |
| `ssh_config`     | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below      |

**Metrics**: `vms_total`, `vms_running`, `vms_stopped`

```yaml
- name: "Virtual Machines"
  id: "server-vms"
  type: "vms"
  interval: 1m
  expect_running:
    - "web"
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"
```

---

### `cloud`
Detects the cloud provider of the target and surfaces its instance metadata (id, type, region/zone) over SSH via the link-local metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`). Auto-detects across AWS (IMDSv2), GCP, and Azure, or query one provider explicitly. Informational — no thresholds; reports online when metadata is reachable, offline when the host isn't on a recognized cloud.

| Option       | Description                                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `provider`   | `auto` (default), `aws`, `gcp`, or `azure`                   |
| `ssh_config` | SSH connection details — see [SSH Config](#ssh-config) below |

**Metrics**: `on_cloud` (1 = on a recognized cloud, 0 = not)

```yaml
- name: "Instance Metadata"
  id: "server-cloud"
  type: "cloud"
  interval: 15m
  provider: "auto"
  ssh_config:
    host: "server.example.com"
```

---

### `group`
A logical container for other monitors. Aggregates the worst-case status of all descendants and displays each child as a collapsible card. Expansion state is preserved across page refreshes within the same server session.

Groups support a CSS grid layout, configurable at both the group level and per-child.

| Option          | Description                                                                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `children`      | A list of nested plugin definitions                                                           |
| `grid_columns`  | Number of equal-width columns in the grid (default: `1` — full-width stacked layout)         |

Each child entry can also set:

| Child Option     | Description                                                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grid_col_span`  | How many grid columns this child occupies (default: `1`)                                     |
| `grid_height`    | Explicit CSS height for the child cell, e.g. `"400px"` (default: auto). Adds a scrollbar if content overflows. |

Groups can be nested to arbitrary depth. Inner groups inherit their own `grid_columns` independently.

```yaml
- name: "System Stats"
  type: "group"
  grid_columns: 3       # 3 equal columns — one subgroup per host
  children:
    - name: "Ragnarok System"
      type: "group"
      grid_columns: 4   # 4 columns — one card per stat (CPU / Mem / Temp / Load)
      children:
        - name: "Ragnarok CPU"
          type: "cpu_usage"
          ...
        - name: "Ragnarok Memory"
          type: "memory_usage"
          ...

# Child spanning multiple columns
- name: "Overview"
  type: "group"
  grid_columns: 3
  children:
    - name: "Processes"
      type: "processes"
      grid_col_span: 2   # spans 2 of 3 columns
      grid_height: "600px"
      ...
    - name: "Uptime"
      type: "uptime"
      ...
```

### Plugin Layout

Every leaf plugin supports a `layout:` key that controls how its widgets are arranged on the detail page. Without a `layout:` block the plugin uses its built-in default grid (defined in the plugin's `_DEFAULT_LAYOUT`).

| `layout` option  | Description                                                                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grid_columns`   | Number of equal-width columns in this plugin's detail grid. Defaults vary by plugin type.            |

Each named widget within a plugin can be overridden:

| Per-widget option | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `col`             | Start column (1-based). Omit to use CSS auto-placement.                                             |
| `row`             | Start row (1-based). Omit to use CSS auto-placement.                                                |
| `col_span`        | How many columns this widget occupies (default: `1`).                                               |
| `row_span`        | How many rows this widget occupies (default: `1`).                                                  |
| `height`          | Explicit CSS height for this cell, e.g. `"400px"`. Adds a scrollbar on overflow (default: auto).   |
| `visible`         | `false` to hide the widget entirely (default: `true`).                                              |

**Widget names by plugin type:**

| Plugin             | Widget names                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uptime`           | `host_card`, `status_card`, `latency_card`, `chart`, `logs`                 |

| `network_usage`    | `host_card`, `iface_card`, `rx_card`, `tx_card`, `rx_chart`, `tx_chart`, `logs` |
| `smart_disk`       | `host_card`, `total_card`, `ok_card`, `failed_card`, `logs`                 |
| `disk_space`       | `host_card`, `path_card`, `threshold_card`, `usage_card`, `avail_card`, `total_card`, `chart`, `logs` |
| `zfs_health`       | `host_card`, `total_card`, `ok_card`, `degraded_card`, `logs`               |
| `zfs_pool`         | `host_card`, `pool_card`, `usage_card`, `threshold_card`, `chart`, `logs`   |

      col_span: 3
```

### SSH Config

All SSH-based plugins (`systemd_service`, `smart_disk`, `zfs_health`, `disk_space`, `network_usage`) accept an `ssh_config` block:

| Field        | Description                                                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `host`       | Remote hostname or IP address                                       |
| `user`       | SSH username (defaults to the current OS user if omitted)           |
| `port`       | SSH port (default: `22`)                                            |
| `key_file`   | Path to a private key file (uses the SSH agent / default key if omitted) |

```yaml
ssh_config:
  host: "myhost.example.com"
  user: "vigil"
  port: 22
  key_file: "/home/vigil/.ssh/id_ed25519"
```

Vigil speaks SSH natively (AsyncSSH) rather than shelling out to the system
`ssh` client, and opens one persistent connection per host — every SSH-based
monitor on that host runs its commands as a channel on that one connection
rather than a separate connection each. Host key verification is
trust-on-first-use: the first successful connection to a host stores its key
(under `$VIGIL_SSH_CONTROL_DIR/known_hosts`, defaulting to a `vigil-ssh`
directory under the system temp dir), and every later connection is checked
against it — a changed key is refused rather than silently accepted.

**The number of monitors you can point at one host is bounded by how many
concurrent SSH sessions that host's `sshd` allows** (`MaxSessions` in
`sshd_config`, default `10`). Vigil caps its own concurrency per host below
that default (8 regular monitors + 2 for long-running jobs like `borg`, at
most 10 total in flight at once), so a host running its `sshd` at the
OpenSSH default is safe by construction — extra monitors queue rather than
fail. Hosts with many monitors, or where jobs may overlap with a burst of
polling, benefit from raising `MaxSessions` in that host's own `sshd_config`
(e.g. `MaxSessions 50`) to reduce queuing.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- SSH access to target machines (SSH key auth recommended)

### Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

### Quick Start

1. Create a `config.yaml` (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).
2. Start the system: `vigil --config config.yaml`
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## Configuration

Vigil uses a YAML file to define the hierarchy of your infrastructure. The YAML config is the **source of truth** for infrastructure definitions; SQLite is used for runtime state and overrides.

```yaml
database:
  path: "vigil.db"

plugins:
  - name: "Internal Network"
    type: "group"
    children:
      - name: "Core Gateway"
        id: "gateway-ping"
        type: "uptime"
        target_host: "192.168.1.1"
        interval: 30

  - name: "Web Servers"
    type: "group"
    children:
      - name: "Nginx Service"
        type: "systemd_service"
        service_name: "nginx.service"
        ssh_config:
          host: "web-01.example.com"
          user: "vigil"
```

### Authentication

By default the dashboard and REST API are unauthenticated — anyone who can reach the port has full read access and can trigger control actions. Set `auth.username` and `auth.password` (or `auth.password_file`, to keep the secret out of the YAML config) to require HTTP Basic Auth on every route:

```yaml
auth:
  username: "admin"
  password_file: "/run/secrets/vigil_dashboard_password"
```

`password_file` is read once at startup. If only one of `username`/`password` is set, auth stays disabled and a warning is logged.

---

## Usage

The primary entry point starts both the background engine and the web dashboard:

```bash
vigil --config config.yaml
```

To run just the dashboard against an existing database:

```bash
vigil-gui --db vigil.db --port 8080
```

### Nix Integration

Vigil supports Flakes for reproducible environments:

```bash
# Enter dev shell
nix develop

# Run via Nix
nix run . -- --config config.yaml
```

---

## Integrations

Beyond the dashboard, Vigil exposes its state to external tools. All of the following are served on the same port as the web UI.

### Events feed

An **Events** view in the sidebar shows a unified, filterable feed of every event Vigil has recorded across all monitors — status changes, threshold crossings, and collection errors — filterable by level, target host, and message text.

### REST API

Read-only JSON endpoints for consuming Vigil's state programmatically:

| Endpoint | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/health` | `{"status": "ok"}` |
| `GET /api/monitors` | All monitors with id, name, type, target, and current status |
| `GET /api/monitors/{id}` | A single monitor plus its latest metrics |
| `GET /api/metrics` | Latest value of every collected metric |
| `GET /api/events` | Recent events — supports `?level=`, `?target=`, `?search=`, `?limit=` |

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/monitors
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/events?level=ERROR&limit=50"
```

### Prometheus

A Prometheus exposition endpoint is always available at `GET /metrics` (pull) — no configuration required. It exports `vigil_up` (per-monitor status: `1` online, `0.5` warning, `0` failed, `-1` offline) and `vigil_metric` (every collected metric, labeled by monitor/target/metric). Point a Prometheus scrape config at it:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: vigil
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['vigil-host:8080']
```

### InfluxDB

An optional **push** exporter ships metrics to InfluxDB (1.x or 2.x) on an interval. Enable it under `exporters:` in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
exporters:
  influxdb:
    url: "http://localhost:8086"
    interval: 30
    # InfluxDB 2.x:
    org: "my-org"
    bucket: "vigil"
    token: "my-api-token"
    # InfluxDB 1.x: use `database:` instead of org/bucket/token
```

---

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Configuration should be intuitive.
2. **No Remote Agent**: All logic stays on the Vigil server; remote hosts only need SSH.
3. **Domain Encapsulation**: Each plugin handles its own collection, alerting, and control logic.
4. **Hierarchical Organization**: Supports nested groups for organizing monitors by location, service, or environment.
5. **Fail-Safe Control**: Control actions must be logged and confirmable.
6. **Standard-Aware**: Aims for OpenTelemetry compatibility in data naming and export capability.
